### Keep On Cluckin'

You've created a simple form, a workflow, and connected them with a trigger. In upcoming lessons, youâ€™ll refine this automation. But first...it's time to learn the basics of Jinja (and demystify all of that "CTX.user\_id," "CTX.group\_id" stuff). Jump to the next lesson when you're ready!
