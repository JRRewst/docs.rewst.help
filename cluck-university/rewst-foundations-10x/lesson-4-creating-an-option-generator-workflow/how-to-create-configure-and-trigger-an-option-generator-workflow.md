# How to Create, Configure, and Trigger an Option Generator Workflow

## Module Overview

:bulb: Planning a workflow before building speeds up the process by sorting out logistics upfront, so you can focus on execution later. The inputs and outputs are key to this moduleâ€”without them, the options generator won't work.

<summary>Step 2: Add Workflow Trigger</summary>

1. _**Select**_ the lightning bolt to add a workflow trigger.
2. **Enter** "option generator" for the name
3. **Toggle** Enabled to enable the trigger.
4. **Search** for "always" in the "trigger type" dropdown
5. **Select** 'Core - Always Pass.'
   * The workflow will trigger as soon as we have a "user" and an "action" selected - before the form is submitted.
6. **Select** Microsoft Graph for integration override.
7. **Select** your own organization
   * Test with a user you're comfortable with (maybe yourself).
   * If you want to use this process for your customers, refer to the special instructions on the Rewst 104 tutorial page in Cluck University
8. **Submit** to save the trigger.

### Action Item

* Create a workflow and configure its properties, inputs, and outputs to function as an Option Generator.
* Setup a trigger for the Option Generator workflow.
* Add an Integration Override to the Option Generator so it can be used across all your managed organizations. This ensures the workflow is flexible and scalable for different environments
