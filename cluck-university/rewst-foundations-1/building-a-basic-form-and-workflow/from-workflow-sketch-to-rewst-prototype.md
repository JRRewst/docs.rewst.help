# From Workflow Sketch to Rewst Prototype

## Module Overview

:bulb: Automation starts with a clear plan. Before diving into Rewst, sketch out what the process looks like and identify the trigger that will initiate this automation.

<summary>Introduction to Workflow Sketching</summary>

It's time to sketch (by hand, or using your favorite flowcharting tool) a simple, prototype workflow for the "Add or Remove User - Microsoft Groups" automation and identify the trigger (the mechanism that "starts" the automation). Your prototype should include:

* A Rewst Form as the Trigger (we'll create the form, and then select it in the "trigger" settings of the workflow)
* A Rewst Workflow with 3 Steps (we'll expand this over the next few lessons)

Here's a visual to use for inspiration:

### Action Items

Sketch your workflow, ensuring youâ€™ve identified the trigger (e.g., a Rewst form). Feel free to use the example from this video as a guide.
