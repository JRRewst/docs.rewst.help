# Forms Portal

## Forms Portal

The **Forms Portal** is a powerful and flexible solution that allows users to view, access, and manage the forms they have permissions for, all from one convenient site. With its intuitive design, users can easily filter and search for forms by name or tag, ensuring a seamless experience.

### Key Features

* **Centralised Form Management**: All forms a user has access to are available in a single location, reducing the time spent searching or navigating to different areas or trying to remember how to get to something specific.
* **Search and Filtering**: Users can quickly search by form name or filter by tags to find the forms they need, making the process more efficient.
* **Customisable Design**: The look and feel of the portal can be fully customised to match your brand or your customers' needs including overall styling guide and logo.

### Customisability with Blumira CSS

We’ve designed the Forms Portal with **customisability** at the forefront. Leveraging **Blumira for CSS** allows you to easily modify the design across the entire site, ensuring it aligns with your or your client’s branding.

#### How it Works:

* **Modular Components**: The portal uses a system of **templates and HTML components** that allow you to modify specific elements or sections as needed, without requiring changes to the entire site. This granular level of control ensures that your customisation efforts are both quick and scalable.
* **Easy Theming**: You can quickly adjust colours and logos with an already-built Rewst form, allowing you to simply enter the hex codes of the colours you want and updating it without you having to learn CSS!

### Why Choose Forms Portal?

* **Efficiency**: Reduce manual work by providing a single location for form access, improving both user experience and productivity.
* **Flexibility**: Customise the look and feel of the portal to match any brand’s identity.
* **Future-Proof**: Easily update your forms and site-wide designs using our modular approach, ensuring that your portal evolves as your business does.
