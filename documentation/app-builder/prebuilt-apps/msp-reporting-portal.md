### Key Features

* **Device Health and Warranty Tracking**: Stay on top of your client devices, with automatic reporting on warranty status, device health, and replacement cycles. Never miss a critical date for warranty expiration or device end-of-life.
* **Ticket Reporting and Trends**: Get a clear picture of your support operation's efficiency. Analyse ticket volumes, response times, and resolutions to ensure your team is performing at its best.

### Customisability with Bulma CSS

#### How It Works:

* **Modular Components**: The Reporting Portal is built on a system of templates and HTML components, allowing you to adjust sections of the portal easily without affecting the entire site.
