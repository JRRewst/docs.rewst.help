# End User Portal

## End User Portal

The **End User Portal** is designed to empower end users by giving them direct access to key automations and self-service tools. With its intuitive and user-friendly design, the portal provides a streamlined, 24/7 solution for users to manage their needs independently, all while keeping the service desk informed and involved. From password resets to new user onboarding, the portal is a one-stop solution for users to take action without needing to pick up the phone or wait for their action to be done manually.

### Key Features

* **Self-Service Automation**: End users can access and run essential workflows, such as password resets, group changes, onboarding, and offboarding, without having to contact the service desk. This ensures quick resolution of routine tasks, reducing strain on your support team.
* **Ticket Logging and Workflow Integration**: Users can still log tickets and receive updates directly from the portal. Any automation action taken is seamlessly integrated with your Rewst workflows, meaning your team is always kept in the loop.
* **Customisable Design**: Just like the Forms Portal, the End User Portal can be fully customised to match your or your clients' branding, including logos, colour schemes, and more.

### Customisability with Bulma CSS

The **End User Portal** leverages the same powerful customisation options as the Forms Portal, using **Bulma for CSS** to ensure that the design aligns perfectly with your brand.

#### How It Works:

* **Modular Components**: Like the Forms Portal, the End User Portal is built with modular templates and HTML components. This allows for precise, site-wide customisations or changes to individual elements, making it easy to update specific sections without affecting the entire site.
* **Easy Theming**: Simply adjust the colours and logos using the pre-built Rewst forms. Just enter your hex codes, enter a link to the logo, and apply the branding site-wide without needing to handle complex CSS.

### Why Choose End User Portal?

* **24/7 Self-Service**: Users can take control of routine requests, like password resets or group changes, anytime they need. No more waiting on calls or opening service tickets for simple tasks.
* **Automate Routine Processes**: The portal integrates directly with Rewst workflows, allowing users to trigger automations that keep your team informed while still reducing the need for manual intervention.
* **Customisable User Experience**: Provide a branded, polished interface that makes your organisation stand out, while also ensuring ease of use for non-technical users.
* **Comprehensive Automation**: Cover a wide range of user needs—onboarding, offboarding, permissions changes, and more—all managed through one unified platform.
